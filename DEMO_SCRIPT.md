## üé¨ Demo Script (3 Minutes)

### **[0:00-0:30] Problem Setup**

**Presenter**: "Let me show you the current state of global payroll."

*[Show traditional payroll interface - slow, expensive, complex]*

**Presenter**: "Traditional cross-border payroll is broken. A $500K monthly payroll loses $15K to fees - that's 3% gone before employees even see their money. Processing takes 7 days, and many talented workers can't access global opportunities due to banking restrictions."

*[Show statistics on screen]*
- üí∏ **5-15% fees** lost to FX and processing
- ‚è∞ **7-day delays** for international transfers  
- üåç **Geographic exclusion** from global opportunities
- üí∞ **Billions wasted** in idle treasury funds
